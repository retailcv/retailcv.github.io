                <p>
                    The growing customer demand for E-commerce is becoming more and more diversified, growing the need for methods that not only require a single modality such as product images, but also call for the usage of textual captions that describe said images. Bridging the gap between visual representation and high-level semantic concepts remains an open research topic for obtaining users' search intentions. This challenge is based on the the AliProducts2 dataset that is designed to bridge this gap. This realistic large-scale and multi-model dataset consists of ~5M image-caption pairs of ~100K fine-grained products. Challenge participants must find the top-K product candidates to match a query such as "blue men's turtleneck sweater". This challenge is a natural continuation of our previous image-only AliProducts challenge which had more than 1000 competing teams.
