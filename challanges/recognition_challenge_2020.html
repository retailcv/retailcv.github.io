                <p>
                    The widespread use of computer vision methods in the retail industry has sparked a new set of challenges, such as the difficult task of correctly distinguishing between a large number of products, especially when the products are quite similar. Tackling this fine-grained classification task may lead to new break-throughs in the field of visual recognition and representation.

                    The AliProducts dataset consists of ∼3M images of ∼50K different products. The dataset covers many categories of daily commodities, including cosmetics, beverages, snacks, etc. The products are in SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) fine-grained level, and it may be difficult to distinguish between some of the products. Handling class imbalance and noisy training data are also highlights of this challenge.
